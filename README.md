# Rishi Durgairajan

üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm Rishi Durgairajan, a passionate junior in high school with a keen interest in Machine Learning and Web Development. üöÄ

üíª Currently diving deep into ML projects where I leverage my skills to create impactful solutions, including emotion detection models and image classifiers. My journey into AI fuels my curiosity and drives me to explore the intersection of technology and creativity.

üåê I‚Äôm gaining valuable experience as a Web Development Intern at Rooted Together, honing my skills in building applications that make a difference, even though my main aspiration is in ML.

ü§ù I'm continually learning from my experiences and collaborations, hoping to contribute meaningfully to the tech community and the projects I engage in.

‚ú® Always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute, I‚Äôm on a mission to use my knowledge to empower others and tackle real-world challenges.
